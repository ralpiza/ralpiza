## Hi there 👋
I am Rafael Alpizar,aspiring GIS professional. 
My experience has led me down the path of a GIS Analyst but I am certainly intrigued by all the different aspects that the geospatial field has expanded into.
After completing a Bachelor's of Art in Geography (option in GIS)and earning a Geospatial Python course certificate from University of Tennessee, Knoxville I have expanded my view on the capability of GIS.
🌱 I’m currently learning skills essential for a GIS Developer.
Such as: Github, python, API's, Data Automation, Cloud-based data integration.
